1. Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
for these interfaces. Only the list of names.
ifconfig 	stands for "interface configuration",it's used to view or change the configuration of the networl interfaces on your system".
eth0   	is the first Ethernet interface.NIC(network interface card, aka ethernet card, network adapter)
lo     	loopback interface
wlan0    wireless network
https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uifconfi.htm

ifconfig -l

2. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics

ifconfig en0
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	options=10b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,AV>
	ether 38:c9:86:56:af:a8
	inet6 fe80::181f:87e:a947:31b%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x5
	inet 10.112.7.37 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 10.112.255.255
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
	media: autoselect (1000baseT <full-duplex,energy-efficient-ethernet>)
	status: active

solution1:grep inet finds line inet6 and inet, grep broadcast narrows the row to inet, then print the second column
ifconfig en0 | grep inet | grep broadcast | awk '{print $2}'
10.112.7.37
solution2:ipconfig getifaddr en0

3. Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card

solution1: ifconfig en1 | grep ether | awk '{ print $2 }'

solution2: networksetup -listallhardwareports | grep -A3 Wi-Fi | sed -n '3p' | awk '{print $3}'
networksetup -listallhardwareports

-n option suppresses the duplicate rows, 

Hardware Port: Ethernet
Device: en0
Ethernet Address: 38:c9:86:56:af:a8

Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en1
Ethernet Address: 28:f0:76:4b:f8:78

Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN
Device: en4
Ethernet Address: 28:f0:76:3f:2c:8d

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 1
Device: en2
Ethernet Address: 1a:00:01:fa:97:a0

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 2
Device: en3
Ethernet Address: 1a:00:01:fa:97:a1

Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge
Device: bridge0
Ethernet Address: 1a:00:01:fa:97:a0

VLAN Configurations

4. Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table
netstat -nr | grep default | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2}'

netstat - Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
show network status, head -n1 print first line, awk '{print $2}' print column 2 of that line.

5. Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: slash16.org

6. Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server
you’re using
7. Query an external DNS server on the slash16.org domain name (ie. : google
8.8.8.8)
8. Find the provider of slash16.org
9. Find the external IP of 42.fr
6
System and Network Administration init
10. Identify the network devices between your computer and the slash16.org domain
11. Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the
device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world
12. Check that the server with the 10.51.1.253 IP address is reachable from your
computer.
13. Figure out the server type.
14. Use the Reverse DNS to find out the name of the server linked to the 10.51.1.81
IP address
15. What file contains the local DNS entries?
16. Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
V.3 System
1. In what file can you find the installed version of your Debian?
2. What command can you use to rename your system?
3. What file has to be modified to make it permanent?
4. What command gives you the time since your system was last booted?
5. Name the command that determines the state of the SSH service.
6. Name the command that reboots the SSH service.
7. Figure out the PID of the SSHD service.
8. What file contains the RSA keys that are authorized to connect via SSH?
7
System and Network Administration init
9. What command lets you know who is connected to the System?
10. Name the command that lists the partition tables of external devices?
11. Name the command that displays the available space left on the system?
12. Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var
13. Name the command that find currently running processes
14. Run the ‘tail -f /var/log/syslog‘ command in background
15. Find the command that kills the background command’s process
16. Find the service which makes it possible to run specific tasks following a regular
schedule
17. Find the command which gives the list of firewall rules
18. With the previous command, authorize only IP addresses from 10.0.0.0/8 to connect
to your system
19. With the previous command, forbid all others
8
System and Network Administration init
V.4 Scripting
1. Write a script which displays only the login, UID and Path of each entry of the
/etc/passwd file.
2. Write a script which updates all the package sources, then all the packages, and then
logs everything in a file named /var/log/update_script.log. Create a scheduled
task for this script, once per week at 4 AM.
3. Write a script which displays the list of files from the folder given as parameter,
sorted by size.
4. Write a script which monitors the modifications made to the /etc/crontab file and
sends an e-mail to root if the file is modified. Create a scheduled task to run this
script everyday at midnight.
man md5sum

md5 = $(md5sum /etc/crontab)//create a string for crontab.txt
if [ -e $(pwd)/hash.txt]//check does txt exist from currect working directory
then
	if [ "$(grep "$md5" hash.txt)" == ""]//if md5 string is emmpty
	then
		echo $md5 > hash.txt//write md5 string to txt
		mail -s "Change to /etc/crontab" root < /etc/crontab//deliver mail to with subject " " to recipient
		root < /etc/crontab sends whatever is in crontab as the body to root
	fi 
else 
	echo $md5 > $(pwd)/hash.txt// to create hash.txt on the first call, cuz no txt exist previously
	mail -s "Change to /etc/crontab" root < /etc/crontab//send crontab content as body to root with subject ""
fi

5. Write a script which displays 42.
